# Unique TLDs

This is a Python script that scans a list of domain names and identifies the unique top-level domains (TLDs) used in the list. It then prints out a list of all the unique TLDs found, to a .csv with path specified by the user.

## Getting Started

You may need to:
``` bash
pip install tldextract
```

Other than that, you should be good to go!

### Future Work

Please reach out if you find any issues or bugs in this script!
